#### Relevant Columns are: 
* Food Name (the name of the food item)
* totalGHG_all (a list of tuples of the countries that produce the food item in that month and the summed impacts of all life cycle stages)
* trade_impacts_GHG (these same impacts but only for countries that trade that item with the country of consumption)
* seasonal_landbio_updated (the biodiversity loss impacts for all countries that can potentially produce that item in that given month)


## This website will build a personalized, low impact diet for an individual without running any code. https://clw208.github.io/nb1/User_Inputs.html

#### Relevant Columns are: Food Name, totalGHG_all, trade_impacts_GHG, seasonal_landbio_updated and these columns represent: the name of the food item, a list of tuples of the countries that produce the food item and the associated impacts of all life cycle stages, these same impacts but only for countries that trade that with the country of consumption, and the biodiversity loss impacts for all countries that can potentially produce that item in that given month.


## This website will build a personalized, low impact diet for an individual without running any code. https://clw208.github.io/nb1/User_Inputs.html

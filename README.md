### This is code to run a tool that does 2 things:

#### 1. Build a database of food items and their nutrients, and calculates the potential environmental impacts for each item, specific to the country and month of consumption.

#### 2. Build personalized, low impact diets using this database.


### All code is programmed in Jupyter Notebooks running Python 3.6


### To build your personalized low impact and healthy diet:
#### Open the User_Inputs notebook, answer the questions, and click the button to build your diet. This will provide you with a list of what specific foods you should eat, the mass of each food, and from what country it should be sourced to minimize your impact.

### If you only want to build the country and season specific database:
#### Open the Build_Optimization Database notebook, add the country and month you want the database built for, and run the notebook. This will provide you a impacts associated with each food item in the database depending on from which country these items can be sourced.

###### Input and Trade folders are supplying necessary data to run the code. 
###### Diet_Optimization_Tool and Foods_to_Include notebooks run the code in the User_Input notebook.
